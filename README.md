### CAPSTONE-B21-CAP0025

### About
At this time, the need for an application that can recommend food and display foods that have the nutrients needed by users (like carbohydrates, protein, fat, etc) for who are on a diet or suffer from certain diseases such as obesity, diabetes, and other diseases, is still considered ineffective due to food recommendations still depending on an expert.

So, how to design and build a food recommender system that can work effectively in showing food choices based on the user's nutritional needs? To answer that, we created the food recommender system for selecting meals based on user nutrition's needs.
